 *
 * Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of
 * two given nodes in the BST.
 *
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor
 * is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p
 * and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
 *
 * Given binary search tree:  root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant
 * of itself according to the LCA definition.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 *
 * All of the nodes' values will be unique.
 * p and q are different and both values will exist in the BST.
